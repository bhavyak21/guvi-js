Difference between Document and Window Objects-

The document object represent a web page that is loaded in the browser. By accessing the document object, 
we can access the element in the HTML page. With the help of document objects, we can add dynamic content 
to our web page. The document object can be accessed with a window.document or just document.
The window object is the topmost object of the DOM hierarchy. It represents a browser window or frame that 
displays the contents of the webpage. Whenever a window appears on the screen to display the contents 
of the document, the window object is created. 
The Document object provides access to the content of the document, including the HTML elements, 
CSS styles, and JavaScript code, whereas the Window object provides access to the browser window's
properties and methods, such as the location, history, and alert() method.
The Document object is created by the browser when a web page is loaded, whereas the Window object is created
by the browser when a new window or tab is opened.
The Document object is the parent object of all other objects in the DOM hierarchy, whereas the Window object 
is the top-level object in the hierarchy and has access to all other objects in the window.
In summary, the Document object represents the content of the web page, while the Window object represents the 
browser window that is displaying the web page.
