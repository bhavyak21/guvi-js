Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2
HTTP stand for Hypertext Transfer Protocol. It is a protocol used by World Wide Web(WWW) to transfer data 
between servers and clients. HTTP has evolved over the years and the latest version is HTTP/2, 
which is an upgraded version of HTTP/1.1. 

HTTP/1.1: Letâ€™s say that we have to make a request to the server for the google.com page and server responds
to us as a resource google.com page. Before sending the request and the response, there is a TCP connection
established between client & server. Again we make a request to the server for image img.jpg and 
the server gives a response as an image img.jpg. The connection was not lost here after the first request 
because we add a keep-alive header which is the part of the request so there is an open connection between 
the server & client. There is a persistent connection which means several requests & responses are merged
in a single connection. These are the drawbacks that lead to the creation of HTTP/2.
The first problem is HTTP/1.1 transfer all the requests & responses in the plain text message form. 
The second one is head of line blocking in which TCP connection blocked all other requests until 
the response does not receive. All the information related to the header file is repeated in every request.

HTTP/2: HTTP/2 was developed over the SPDY protocol. HTTP/2 works on the binary framing layer 
instead of textual that converts all the messages in binary format. It works on multiplexing in which
one TCP connection is used for multiple requests. HTTP/2 uses HPACK which is used to split data from header and 
compresses it. The server sends all the other files like CSS & JS without the request of the client 
using the PUSH frame.
